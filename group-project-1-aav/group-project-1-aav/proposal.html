        <h2>Problem/Data Domain</h2>
        <p>
            Pokémon, also known as Pocket Monsters in Japan, is a Japanese media franchise managed by the Pokémon Company, a company founded by Nintendo, Game Freak, and Creatures <cite><a href="https://www.britannica.com/topic/Pokemon-electronic-game">(Britannica)</a></cite>
        </p>
        <p>
            Pokémon are creatures of all shapes and sizes who live in the wild or alongside humans. There are currently more than 700 creatures that inhabit the Pokémon universe <cite><a href="https://www.nintendo.com.au/what-is-pokemon#:~:text=Pok%C3%A9mon%20are%20creatures%20of%20all,the%20wild%20or%20alongside%20humans.&text=Pok%C3%A9mon%20are%20raised%20and%20commanded,occasion%2C%20evolve%20into%20stronger%20Pok%C3%A9mon.">(Nintendo)</a></cite>.
        </p>
        <p>
            Pokémon is the highest-grossing entertainment franchise of all time <a href="https://www.washingtonpost.com/video-games/2019/11/15/pokemon-is-everywhere-now-long-live-pokemon/">(WashingtonPost)</a></cite>, and continues to grow in popularity.
        </p>
        <p>
            While web applications already exist to capture and present information about these Pokémon, we noticed that with such large amounts of data available, there exists a lack of functionality to search and filter through the information to retrieve the data users may be looking for. For example, on <a href="https://pokedex.org/"> pokedex.org </a>, users are only able to search for Pokémon by name, but may want to search for certain types of pokemon, or by their stats.

            With our app, we intend to help Pokémon enthusiasts find the data they are searching for more easily by incorporating functionality that allows users to filter through our database using other attributes possessed by Pokémon.

        <h2>App Description</h2>
        <p>This web page will act as an interactive encyclopedia for different Pokémon. Our users are people who want to learn more about Pokémon.</p>
        <h3>Proposed Functionality</h3>
        <ul>
            <li>Filter based on type</li>
            <li>Filter based on stats</li>
            <li>View detail pages for each Pokémon</li>
        </ul>
        <h3>Data</h3>
        <p>We will be utilizing two data sets we found on Kaggle to populate our collection. </p>
        <ul>
            <li><a href="https://www.kaggle.com/abcsds/pokemon">Pokemon with stats</a></li>
            <li><a href="https://www.kaggle.com/vishalsubbiah/pokemon-images-and-types">Pokemon Image Dataset</a></li>
        </ul>
        <h3>Solution</h3>
        <p>While Pokémon databases already exist, this app will provide users with more detail and the ability to filter and search for Pokémon through more categories.</p>
